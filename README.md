## Overview

__Pine Seeds__ is a service to import your custom data and access it via [TradingView](https://tradingview.com).

This service allows you to:

- connect your series data to TradingView
- open it on the TradingView chart
- use it in the custom indicators

Use [TradingView](https://tradingview.com) as your __frontend__ and use a GitHub repository as your __backend__.

Keep in mind that such data (we call them EOD data, short for End-of-Day) has certain limitations:

- the data can only be updated 5 times per day
- only daily-based timeframes (1D and above) can be applied to such data
- the number of data elements (symbols) is [limited][data_limits] to 6000
- such data [will not appear][ui_symbol_search] in the symbol search box

Setting up the service includes several steps:

1. Setting up a [repository][repo].
2. [Data preparation][data].
3. Manipulating data in the [TradingView UI][ui].

## Example

You can take the [seed_crypto_santiment] project as a reference for your repository.
The project has the proper structure for symbol data.

You can also open symbols from [seed_crypto_santiment] on the [TradingView chart][chart] and work with it.
For example, `SEED_CRYPTO_SANTIMENT:BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY` is an example of custom data integration.
The symbol name is uniquely determined by the GitHub settings.

- `SEED` is a required prefix.
- `CRYPTO` is the account name `github.com/crypto`.
- `SANTIMENT` is the suffix of the GitHib repository name `github.com/crypto/seed_crypto_santiment`.
    The suffix is needed so that you can use several repositories for different data groups,
    e.g., `seed_<username>_<suffix1>`, `seed_<username>_<suffix2>`.
- `BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY` is the `BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY.CSV` data file name.

Using the built-in [`request.seed()`][pine_refs] function from the [Pine Scriptâ„¢ language][pine_docs] and the available data, you can build a chart.

```js
//@version=5
indicator("BTC Dev Activity", format=format.volume)
//request.seed(source, symbol, expression)
activity = request.seed("seed_crypto_santiment", "BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY", close)
plot(activity, "BTC Dev Activity")
```

By adding Bitcoin developer activity data from the EOD source (`SEED_CRYPTO_SANTIMENT:BTC_DEV_ACTIVITY`) to the `BTCUSD` chart,
you will receive additional information for technical analysis.
